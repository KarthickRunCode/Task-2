1.Write a blog on the difference between document & window objects


Document Object:
	The document object represents a web page that is loaded in the browser. By accessing the document object, we can access the element in the HTML page. With the help of a document object , we can add dynamic content to our page. The document object can be accessed with a window .document or just document.

Syntax:
	document.property_name;

Window object:
	The window object is the topmost object of the DOM hierarchy. It represents a browser window or frame that displays the contents of the webpage. Whenever a window appears on the screen to display the contents of the document the window object is created.

Syntax:
	window.property_name;

Document:
	It represents any HTML document or web page that is loaded in the browser.
It is loaded inside the window.
	It is the object of window property.
	All the tags, elements with attributes in HTML are part of the document.
	We can access the document from a window using the window. Document
The document is part of BOM (browser object model) and dom (Document object model)
	Properties of document objects such as title, body, cookies, etc can also be accessed by a window like this window. document.title
example: 
document.title :  will return the title of the document

Window object:
	It is the object of the browser.
	Global objects, functions, and variables of JavaScript are members of the window object.
	We can access the window from the window only. i.e. window.window
	The window is part of BOM, not DOM.
	Properties of the window object cannot be accessed by the document object.
Example:
window.innerHeight : will return the height of the content area of the browser
	In this article, we will see the Document object & Window object, their various properties & methods, along with knowing their implementation & the differences between them.
